Every time that a ship from a user visits a new ss make it visible for the galaxy overview


a user when does a move of a ship/fleet will set will_be_finished_at of the calculation of the trip depending on the ship tipe, compoents, etc.
when the ship arrives to the destination the will_be_finished_at will be set to null and the ship will be on the new location
the previous sentence will be triggered by an event (that will be triggered in certain pages) or in the future with a cron
